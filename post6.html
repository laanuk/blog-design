              <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1" id="story" style="width:100%; margin-left: 0px;">
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Asian Roots</h2>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                  Red folds of wedding dress<br>
                  Corals and crystals, the necklace of a wife<br>
                  Bangles,  golden as sunset<br>
                  A part of Mother’s life<br>
                  <br>
                  Her home was Bombay, the city of sound<br>
                  From the shouts in the terraces to the wheels on the ground<br>
                  Aromas of spices from the bazaar<br>
                  People in and out by the hazaar<br>
                  And a certain yellow house with a nearby lake<br>
                  With my aunts and uncle and a garden with a rake<br>
                  Guarded by two dogs that made half the uproar<br>
                  Of Bombay’s great din with its crowds and its stores<br>
                  It wasn’t Egypt, it wasn’t great Rome<br>
                  But it was my mother’s beloved home<br>
                  <br>
                  But all was different when it was my mother’s turn<br>
                  To get married and change; there was much to learn<br>
                  Of new types of people and new types of coins<br>
                  And a new, American home in Des Moines<br>
                  Everything silent, everything still<br>
                  And a gloomy, snowy sky with a terrible chill<br>
                  No more spices and no more crowds<br>
                  No more noises incredibly loud<br>
                  And loved family members countries away<br>
                  Without  Mother’s sisters and brothers, Des Moines seemed gray<br>
                  <br>
                  But life went on<br>
                  Mother began to not mind<br>
                  In new people and snow she began to find<br>
                  New parts of herself that came by and by<br>
                  Learning to love it all was like learning to fly<br>
                  <br>
                  But that wasn’t all<br>
                  She had gained so much more<br>
                  She had accomplishments and memories galore<br>
                  And a son who was smart, funny, and tall<br>
                  Mother could even cook without burning it all<br>
                  Then after many years, in California, The Golden State<br>
                  It just might have been luck, chance, or fate<br>
                  That a daughter came along, a girl who was me<br>
                  A girl with different surroundings, who grew up differently<br>
                  Like two ends of a rainbow<br>
                  Were my mother and I<br>
                  Knowing different shades of life, different blues in the sky<br>
                  I stood up each day with my hand on my heart<br>
                  Reciting the Pledge  to a flag of red, white, and blue<br>
                  Mother’s country was so far apart<br>
                  She sang the anthem she knew<br>
                  Each night I craved for a dinner of Chinese or Thai<br>
                  Yet Mother, at my age, only knew of dosas and fish fry<br>
                  But together we make all the colors in the sky<br>
                  With each side of our spectrum, my mother and I<br>
                  <br>
                  I did not have an accent, like the one Mother had<br>
                  But I knew Indian traditions passed down from Mom and Dad<br>
                  I watched fireworks in July, but lit diyas on Diwali<br>
                  Anne of Green Gables sat on my bed, but also books in Hindi<br>
                  Yes, I ate burgers, but gobbled roti<br>
                  I became who I am from my parents’ story<br>
                </p>
